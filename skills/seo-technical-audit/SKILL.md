name: seo-technical-audit
description: Focused one-shot technical SEO audit for a domain. Crawlability, indexability, security, mobile, structured data, JS rendering — single-pass deliverable, not a diff. Distinct from `seo-drift` (which tracks changes over time) and from `seo-page` (which audits keywords/traffic for one URL, not technical health). Use when the user asks "technical audit", "site audit", "audit my site", "crawl issues", "indexation issues", or "technical SEO check".

# Technical Audit

A one-shot technical SEO audit for a domain. Pulls SE Ranking's audit data, categorizes findings by area (crawlability, indexability, security, mobile, structured data, etc.), severity-sorts within each, and produces a top-10 fix list ranked by impact × effort.

## Prerequisites

- SE Ranking MCP server connected.
- Claude's `WebFetch` tool available (used for sense-checking robots.txt and sitemap presence).
- User provides: a target domain (e.g. `example.com`). Optional: target country (default `us`), audit-page-limit override (default: rely on the existing audit's limit).

## Process

1. **Validate target & preflight**
   - Normalise domain (strip protocol, trailing slash).
   - `DATA_getCreditBalance` — surface remaining credits. A re-check of an existing audit is cheap; creating a new audit is significantly more expensive (cost varies by page count). Surface the cost before deciding.
   - **Firecrawl availability check.** If `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_scrape` is available, step 8 (Modern signals checklist) runs on 5 sample URLs and `/robots.txt` (~6 Firecrawl credits, hard cap). Without it, that step is skipped — the SE Ranking audit data still produces the full technical-audit deliverable, but without JS-render canonical/noindex divergence, X-Robots-Tag headers, or AI-crawler robots-rule analysis. User may pass `--no-firecrawl` to skip step 8 even when Firecrawl is available (saves credits).

2. **Find or create the audit** `DATA_listAudits`
   - List audits for the domain.
   - If a recent audit exists (<30 days old), use it.
   - If older than 30 days, run `DATA_recheckAudit` to refresh.
   - If none exists, ask the user before creating a new one with `DATA_createStandardAudit` (it consumes credits).
   - Wait for `DATA_getAuditStatus` to report `done` before pulling the report.

3. **Pull the audit report** `DATA_getAuditReport`
   - Top-line metrics: pages crawled, health score, total issues by severity.
   - Issues grouped by category (crawlability, indexability, mobile, security, structured data, etc.).

4. **Pull per-issue page lists** `DATA_getAuditPagesByIssue`
   - For each significant issue (severity ≥ medium, count ≥ 5), pull the affected URLs.
   - This produces the actionable fix list.

5. **Cross-reference key URLs** `DATA_getIssuesByUrl`
   - For the top 5 pages by traffic (from `DATA_getDomainKeywords`'s page aggregation, or homepage + key landing pages if no keyword data), pull all issues for those specific URLs.
   - This catches cases where one important page concentrates many issues.

6. **Sense-check** `WebFetch`
   - Fetch `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` directly.
   - Confirm the audit's findings match reality on these critical files (audits sometimes lag behind same-day deploys).

7. **Categorize and prioritize** using `references/severity-mapping.md`
   - Map each issue code to severity, fix, and effort estimate.
   - Score each finding: severity × affected-page-count / effort.
   - Build the top-10 fix list.

8. **Modern signals checklist** `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_scrape`
   - SE Ranking's audit crawler doesn't execute JS and doesn't expose response headers per page. This step surfaces what's invisible to it.
   - **If Firecrawl available** (~6 Firecrawl credits, hard cap): pick 5 sample URLs from the audit — bias toward high-traffic landing pages and pages already flagged with noindex / canonical issues. For each:
     - **JS-rendered canonical vs initial-HTML canonical.** Compare `metadata.canonical` (after JS render) against the canonical the audit recorded. Flag any divergence — JS-injected canonical changes silently break indexing on JS-heavy sites.
     - **JS-rendered noindex.** Check `metadata.robots` for `noindex` after render. Catches client-side-only `noindex` injection that the audit can't see.
     - **X-Robots-Tag header.** Read response headers from `metadata`. Flag any `noindex` / `nofollow` / `none` directives at the HTTP layer.
     - Then make one additional call: `firecrawl_scrape` on `/robots.txt` (1 credit). Parse for AI-crawler User-Agent rules — `GPTBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `PerplexityBot`, `Google-Extended`, `ChatGPT-User`, `Bytespider`, `CCBot`. Surface allow/disallow scope per agent.
   - **If Firecrawl unavailable:** skip this step. Note in `TECH-AUDIT.md`: `Modern signals (JS canonical/noindex divergence, X-Robots-Tag, AI-crawler robots.txt rules): skipped — Firecrawl not installed.`

9. **Synthesise** `TECH-AUDIT.md`

## Output format

Create a folder `seo-technical-audit-{target-slug}-{YYYYMMDD}/` with:

```
seo-technical-audit-{target-slug}-{YYYYMMDD}/
├── 01-audit-summary.md         (DATA_getAuditReport top-line)
├── 02-issues-by-category/
│   ├── crawlability.md
│   ├── indexability.md
│   ├── security.md
│   ├── mobile.md
│   ├── structured-data.md
│   └── content.md
├── 03-key-pages-issues.md       (top 5 traffic pages, all their issues)
├── 04-robots-sitemap-snapshot.md (raw fetched files)
├── 05-modern-signals.md          (JS-render canonical/noindex divergence, X-Robots-Tag, AI-crawler rules — requires Firecrawl)
├── issues.csv                   (every issue: code, severity, count, fix, effort)
└── TECH-AUDIT.md                (synthesised: top-10 fix list + category summary)
```

`TECH-AUDIT.md` follows this shape:

```markdown
# Technical Audit: {domain}

> Audit date {YYYY-MM-DD} · Pages crawled: {n} · Health score: {n}/100

## Summary

## Top 10 fixes (impact × effort)

| Rank | Issue | Severity | Pages | Fix | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | {issue name} | {severity} | {n} | {one-line fix} | {S/M/L} |

## By category

### Crawlability ({n} issues)
- {issue name} ({n} pages) — {fix}
- ...

### Indexability ({n} issues)
- ...

- ...

### Mobile ({n} issues)
- ...

### Structured data ({n} issues)
- ...

### Content ({n} issues)
- ...

### Modern signals ({n} findings — Firecrawl)
- {URL} — initial-HTML canonical `{X}` differs from JS-rendered canonical `{Y}` (divergence)
- {URL} — JS-rendered `noindex` not visible to static crawler
- {URL} — `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` at HTTP layer
- robots.txt — `GPTBot`: {allow / disallow `/path`}, `ClaudeBot`: {…}, `Google-Extended`: {…}, ...
- (Or: `Modern signals: skipped — Firecrawl not installed`)

## Key-page deep dives

### {URL with most issues}
{n} issues found. Top fixes:
1. ...
2. ...

## Recommended cadence
Re-run this skill monthly to catch regressions, or wire `seo-drift` to baseline + diff between audits.
```

`issues.csv` columns: `category,issue_code,issue_name,severity,affected_pages,suggested_fix,effort,priority_score`

## Tips

- Respect rate limit: 10 req/sec.
- Reuse existing audits when possible — creating a new audit is the most expensive operation.
- A fresh audit on a 1k-page site can take 10–30 minutes to complete. The skill polls `DATA_getAuditStatus` until `done` — be patient.
- The severity scale comes from SE Ranking's audit (not arbitrary). Map them via `references/severity-mapping.md` so impact × effort scoring is consistent run-to-run.
- For sites with >10k pages, consider auditing critical sections separately (set audit URL filters in SE Ranking) rather than crawling the whole site every time.
- Pair with `seo-drift` for regression tracking: this skill is the snapshot, drift is the diff.
- Pair with `seo-sitemap` for orphan/missing-page analysis (it consumes this skill's audit data).
- Don't auto-apply fixes. The skill diagnoses; humans decide which fixes to ship and in what order.
