description: SE Ranking API integration architect. Covers the whole SE Ranking surface — the Data API (keyword research, backlinks, domain & competitor analysis, SERP, website audit, AI Search) and the Project API (rank tracking, project/keyword/backlink management, marketing plan, sub-accounts, AIRT prompts). Answers any "how do I…" question about endpoints, parameters, JSON schemas, credit cost, rate limits, or auth, and produces ready-to-paste cURL / Python / TypeScript / MCP-tool-call recipes. With explicit confirmation it also wires up Project API state — creating projects, adding keywords, configuring audits, setting up AIRT prompt groups. Pulls live tool schemas from the connected MCP. Unlike the analysis skills (briefs, audits, reports), seo-api produces integration recipes and wired-up state. Use when the user asks how to use the SE Ranking API, which endpoint returns a metric, how to build a rank tracker, for Postman / cURL / Python recipes, or how to integrate with Looker / n8n / Make.

# SE Ranking API Integration Architect

Help developers ship real integrations against the SE Ranking SEO Data API and Project API. The deliverable is either a **code recipe** (ready-to-paste cURL / Python / TypeScript / MCP-tool-call sequence) or **live wiring** of Project API state (create projects, add keywords, configure audits, set up AIRT prompts), or both. The skill knows the entire 195-tool surface, the credit and rate-limit cost of every call, and the canonical setup story for every major MCP client.

## Prerequisites

- **SE Ranking MCP connected** at `https://api.seranking.com/mcp`. Single API key authenticates both `DATA_*` and `PROJECT_*` tools through the unified gateway. If `/mcp` doesn't show `se-ranking`, the skill emits the install command and stops — see `references/auth-and-keys.md`.
- **(Optional) `WebFetch`** for fetching deep guides at `seranking.com/api/data/*` and `seranking.com/api/project/*` when the request needs prose beyond JSON Schema.
- User provides: an integration goal in plain language (e.g., "build a rank tracker for client X", "pull all backlinks for these 50 domains into BigQuery weekly", "configure an audit + AIRT prompts for a new project"). The skill interviews only when the goal is ambiguous.

## Process

1. **Preflight.**
   - Confirm the SE Ranking MCP is reachable. If not, emit:
     ```bash
     claude mcp add --transport http se-ranking https://api.seranking.com/mcp
     ```
     and stop. See `references/auth-and-keys.md` for OAuth vs. `X-Api-Key` header tradeoffs and headless / CI patterns.
   - Call `DATA_getSubscription` (0 credits). Record `units_left`, plan status, expiration — `units_left` is the figure to forecast against, and it gets printed in the cost forecast in step 5. Optionally also call `DATA_getCreditBalance` for its `{ limit, used }` view — but the two are **not** aliases: they report different remaining-credit numbers that do not reconcile (an ~8.6M gap is normal), so treat `getSubscription.units_left` as the source of truth.

2. **Clarify the goal.** Ask 1–3 questions only if the goal is ambiguous. Skip when the user already spelled it out. Useful follow-ups:
   - "Is this a one-off run, a recurring job (daily/weekly), or a long-lived integration in your product?"
   - "Target country / language / device — or worldwide?"
   - "Are we operating on a project you already own in SE Ranking, or just researching domains?"

3. **Identify the API surface(s).** Map the goal to one or both of:
   - **Data API** — research-shaped data on any domain, no prior account setup. Credit-billed. See `references/api-surface-map.md` § "Data API surfaces".
   - **Project API** — operations on the user's own SE Ranking projects (rank tracking, audits, AIRT, backlink groups, marketing plan, sub-accounts). Subscription-limit-billed, not credit-billed. Requires Business or Enterprise plan. See `references/api-surface-map.md` § "Project API surfaces".
   - Many real integrations span both — e.g., a rank-tracker setup uses `PROJECT_createProject` + `PROJECT_addKeywords` + `PROJECT_runPositionCheck`, then reports use `DATA_getDomainKeywords` for the same domain.

4. **Map to tools / endpoints.** For every step in the integration, name:
   - The MCP tool: `` `DATA_getDomainKeywords` `` or `` `PROJECT_addKeywords` ``.
   - The underlying REST endpoint + HTTP verb (e.g., `GET /v1/domain/keywords`).
   - The credit cost (Data API) or limit consumed (Project API). Source costs from `references/rate-limits-and-credits.md` and the per-endpoint pages at `seranking.com/api/data/*` — MCP tool `description` fields carry input schemas and usage notes but **not** credit costs.
   - If a tool needs an ID the user didn't supply (project ID, search engine ID, geo region name, language code), insert the prerequisite `*list*` or `*available*` call before it. See `references/api-surface-map.md` § "ID resolution".

5. **Forecast cost.** Sum credit cost across all Data API calls. For Project API calls, surface plan-limit impact (e.g., "this consumes 1 Site + 50 Keywords + ~500 Audit Pages from your plan"). Compare against:
   - `units_left` from step 1 — if insufficient, surface and stop with the upgrade link.
   - Plan limits if Project API tools are involved — `PROJECT_getUserProfile` returns current usage; flag if the integration would push a limit over.

6. **Pick execution mode.** Confirm with the user explicitly:
   - **Code mode** — emit ready-to-paste cURL, Python (`requests`), TypeScript (`fetch`), and MCP-tool-call variants. The developer runs them. Default for read-only research, recurring jobs the user wants to own, and anything they want to deploy outside their Claude session.
   - **Live mode** — execute the integration step by step via MCP. Confirm every mutating call. Default for one-off Project API setup (new project, add keywords, configure audit, set up AIRT prompt group, etc.) where the user wants the state to exist by the end of this conversation.
   - **Hybrid** — wire up the one-time setup live, emit code for the recurring workload (e.g., "I created the project and added the 50 keywords for you; here's the daily-run Python script to pull positions and write them to BigQuery").

7. **Execute or emit.**
   - **Code mode** — write `code/curl.sh`, `code/python.py`, `code/typescript.ts`, `code/mcp-calls.md`. Each file is a complete runnable example, not a fragment. Include error handling for `429` (rate limit) and `403` (insufficient credits). See `references/integration-patterns.md` for canonical pattern snippets.
   - **Live mode** — for each *mutating* call (`PROJECT_create*`, `PROJECT_add*`, `PROJECT_delete*`, `PROJECT_update*`, `DATA_createStandardAudit`, `DATA_createAdvancedAudit`, etc.), print a single-line confirmation:
     ```
     About to call PROJECT_createProject(domain="acme.com", name="ACME Inc — Rank Tracker", country="us").
     Consumes: 1 "Site" from your subscription. Proceed? [y/N]
     ```
     Wait for explicit `y` / `yes`. On anything else, fall back to code mode and emit the equivalent code instead of executing. Read-only calls (`DATA_get*`, `DATA_list*`, `PROJECT_get*`, `PROJECT_list*`) run without confirmation. Log every call to `evidence/03-execution-log.md` with timestamp, args, response status.

8. **Synthesise `RECIPE.md`.** Always written, regardless of mode. The deliverable a developer reads to understand what was built or how to build it. See output format below.

## Output format

Folder `seo-api-{slug}-{YYYYMMDD}/` where `{slug}` is a kebab-case summary of the goal (e.g., `acme-rank-tracker`, `bulk-backlinks-bigquery`).

```
seo-api-{slug}-{YYYYMMDD}/
├── RECIPE.md                       (primary deliverable — what was built or how to build it)
├── code/
│   ├── curl.sh                     (cURL one-liners + multi-step bash)
│   ├── python.py                   (idiomatic requests-based script)
│   ├── typescript.ts               (fetch + zod-validated responses)

└── evidence/
    ├── 01-preflight.md             (credit balance, subscription status, MCP connectivity check)
    ├── 02-cost-forecast.md         (per-call cost breakdown, plan-limit deltas, total)
    ├── 03-ids-resolved.md          (Project API / search-engine IDs, geo codes resolved upfront — omit if none needed)
    └── 04-execution-log.md         (every MCP call executed, with args + status — omit in pure code mode where nothing ran)
```

Top-level: `RECIPE.md` + `code/`. The `evidence/` folder preserves the reasoning trail; auditors lean on `02-cost-forecast.md` and the execution log. `03` and `04` are conditional — a run with no ID lookups and no executed calls (pure code-mode advice) ships just `01` + `02`.

`RECIPE.md` follows this shape:

```markdown
# {Integration Title}: {target}

> Run dated {YYYY-MM-DD} · Mode: {code | live | hybrid} · Total cost: {n} credits + {plan-limits consumed}

## Goal

{1–2 sentences. What was asked, what's being shipped.}

## API surface map

| Step | MCP tool | REST endpoint | Verb | Cost |
|------|----------|---------------|------|------|
| 1    | `DATA_getCreditBalance` | `/v1/account/subscription` | GET | 0 credits |
| 2    | `PROJECT_listProjects` | `/v1/account/projects` | GET | 0 (plan limit: read) |
| 3    | `PROJECT_createProject` | `/v1/projects` | POST | 1 Site from plan |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Auth & setup

{cURL header / Python session / TypeScript fetch wrapper showing exactly how to authenticate. Reference `references/auth-and-keys.md` for OAuth vs. header tradeoffs.}

## Cost forecast

- Credit cost (Data API): {n} credits ({explanation per call})
- Plan-limit consumption (Project API): {Sites: n, Keywords: n, Audit Pages: n, AIRT Prompts: n}
- Your balance at run time: {units_left} credits, {plan limits available}
- {OK / WARNING: this integration would push X over plan limit}

## Recipe

### Option A — cURL

(complete bash script in `code/curl.sh`)

### Option B — Python

(complete script in `code/python.py`)

### Option C — TypeScript

(complete script in `code/typescript.ts`)

### Option D — MCP tool calls

(agent-native sequence in `code/mcp-calls.md` — for when this integration lives inside another Claude/Cursor/Codex workflow)

## Rate limit & retry strategy

- Data API: 10 RPS, Project API: 5 RPS. Pace sequentially for batched workflows; small-batch parallelism (≤3 concurrent) is safe.
- 429 handling: exponential backoff with jitter (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s, ±20% jitter). 5xx: same. Treat 403 "Insufficient funds" as terminal — no retry.

## What you still need to do

{Concrete next steps for the developer. E.g., "Run `python.py` daily via cron at 06:00 UTC", "Open the project at https://online.seranking.com/...", "Add a webhook for rank changes via Settings → Notifications".}

## Linked docs

- {Direct links to the relevant pages on `seranking.com/api/data/*` and `seranking.com/api/project/*`.}

## When to escalate to another skill

- `seo-content-brief` — once your integration is pulling keyword data, this skill turns it into editor briefs.
- `seo-technical-audit` — if the integration involves website audits, this skill interprets the audit output.
- `seo-drift baseline` — if the integration's job is to track a domain over time, snapshot it first.
```

## Tips

- **Single API key authenticates everything.** `API_TOKEN` (or `X-Api-Key` header for headless) covers both `DATA_*` and `PROJECT_*`. The legacy split into separate Data and Project keys is gone — passing both still works as headers for backwards compatibility, but you can use just `X-Api-Key` now. See `references/auth-and-keys.md`.
- **Rate limits are per-API-key, not per-IP.** All threads / workers / servers sharing one key contribute to the same 10-RPS (Data) or 5-RPS (Project) budget. For production fan-outs, mint multiple keys via the API Dashboard.
- **Failed requests are free.** 4xx and 5xx never consume credits. Don't over-engineer cost protection for normal error retries.
- **Project API limits are not credits.** They consume your subscription's "Sites", "Keywords", "Audit Pages", "AIRT Prompts" quotas. Surface plan-limit impact upfront for any mutating call — these limits are stickier than credits because the user has to upgrade their plan to lift them, not just buy a credit pack.
- **Confirm before mutating.** `PROJECT_create*`, `PROJECT_add*`, `PROJECT_delete*`, `PROJECT_update*`, `DATA_create*Audit`, `DATA_deleteAudit` all permanently modify account state. Always print a one-line summary (tool, args, what gets consumed) and wait for `y`/`yes` before calling.
- **Use the right ID resolution tool.** Most "I want to operate on project X / keyword Y" requests need an ID lookup first. See `references/api-surface-map.md` § "ID resolution" for the full table. Common cases:
  - Project IDs → `PROJECT_listProjects` (or `PROJECT_listOwnedProjects` / `PROJECT_listSharedProjects` for sub-account setups).
  - Search engine for rank tracking → pass `country_code` directly to `PROJECT_addSearchEngine` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2). Only fall back to `PROJECT_getAvailableSearchEngines` for regional engines (Catalonia, Turkish-Cypriot Cyprus).
  - SERP locations → `DATA_getSerpLocations`.
  - Languages → `PROJECT_getGoogleLanguages`.
  - Regions for local rank tracking → `PROJECT_getAvailableRegions` (use the verbatim `name` field; abbreviations are rejected).
- **For exports, poll the status endpoint.** Async endpoints (`/backlinks/export`, `/keywords/export`) return a task ID; subsequent polls of `*ExportStatus` count against the rate limit but cost 0 credits. Start with a 5s poll interval; exponential backoff if the task is large.
- **Check the MCP tool description before WebFetching docs.** Every MCP tool exposes its full input schema, defaults, and usage notes via the protocol — e.g. `DATA_getDomainCompetitors` documents its own ~60KB response cap. One thing the descriptions do *not* carry: credit costs — for those, use `references/rate-limits-and-credits.md` and the public per-endpoint pages.
- **Large list endpoints can overflow the MCP transport.** `DATA_getDomainCompetitors` on a popular domain — and `DATA_getDomainKeywords` / `DATA_getAllBacklinks` on big domains — return responses past the MCP client's inline token limit; the result is auto-saved to a file instead. Recover it with a `jq` slice on the saved file, or call the REST endpoint directly (raw REST has no size cap). See `references/api-surface-map.md`.
- **For "show me Swagger / OpenAPI for the MCP"** — point the developer at MCP Inspector (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector https://api.seranking.com/mcp`) or `mcp-scan`. Both walk the live tool/prompt/resource catalogue. A canonical MCP→OpenAPI converter is on the roadmap; for now the inspector output is the source of truth.

## Works well with

- **Predecessors:** none — entry point for any API integration question.
- **Successors (when the integration starts producing data):**
  - `seo-content-brief` — when the integration pulls keyword research that should become editor briefs.
  - `seo-page` — when one URL from the integration needs a keep/refresh/consolidate/kill verdict.
  - `seo-drift baseline` — to snapshot a domain or URL before the integration starts running, so regressions are detectable.
  - `seo-technical-audit` — when the integration involves audit runs and the output needs prioritisation.
  - `seo-ai-search-share-of-voice` — when the integration tracks AIRT visibility and needs a competitive read.
