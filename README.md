# SE Ranking MCP Skills

Production-ready [Claude Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) for the [SE Ranking SEO Data API MCP server](https://github.com/seranking/seo-data-api-mcp-server). Each skill turns raw API data into a finished SEO deliverable: a content brief, a share-of-voice report, an audit change log, a backlink prospect list, a cluster plan, a gap analysis, a demand-gen landing page.

These skills are designed to work with the SE Ranking MCP server, but they document every API call explicitly so they can also be adapted to other SEO data providers.

## Skills

| Skill | What it produces | Primary triggers |
|---|---|---|
| [`content-brief`](skills/content-brief/SKILL.md) | Writer-ready editor brief from a domain and topic, with keyword research, SERP analysis, competitor content teardown, internal linking plan, and AI Search angle | "content brief", "blog brief", "article outline", "editor brief" |

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com), the Claude API, or [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) with Skills enabled.
- The [SE Ranking MCP server](https://github.com/seranking/seo-data-api-mcp-server) installed and configured.
- A `DATA_API_TOKEN` set in your environment. Some skills also benefit from a `PROJECT_API_TOKEN` if you want to use project-scoped tools (rank tracking, AIRT prompts).
- [Sign up for SE Ranking API access](https://seranking.com/api.html) if you don't already have a token.

## Install

### Option 1: Claude Code plugin (recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/seranking/seranking-mcp-skills.git

# Test the plugin locally
claude --plugin-dir ./seranking-mcp-skills
```

Skills are namespaced under the plugin. Trigger them with:

```
/seranking-mcp-skills:content-brief
/seranking-mcp-skills:ai-search-share-of-voice
```

To install permanently, see Claude Code's [plugin marketplace docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### Option 2: Copy individual skills

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/seranking/seranking-mcp-skills.git

# Copy a single skill to your user-scoped skills directory
cp -r seranking-mcp-skills/skills/content-brief ~/.claude/skills/

# Or copy all of them
cp -r seranking-mcp-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Skills copied this way are not namespaced. Trigger them directly by description match.

### Option 3: Project-scoped install

Copy into a specific project's `.claude/skills/` directory to make the skills available only when Claude Code runs in that project.

```bash
cp -r seranking-mcp-skills/skills/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/
```

### Option 4: Claude API

Upload any skill as a zip to the Claude API via the `/v1/skills` endpoints. See [Anthropic's Skills API guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide).

## How these skills work

Each skill is a single `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter. Claude loads the frontmatter at startup to know when to use the skill, then loads the body only when triggered, then reads any bundled reference files only when needed. This is Anthropic's [progressive disclosure](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) pattern.

A typical skill run produces:

1. A set of numbered raw-data markdown files (`01-domain-overview.md`, `02-competitors.md`, etc.) for auditability.
2. Optionally, a CSV for spreadsheet work.
3. A final synthesised deliverable (`BRIEF.md`, `REPORT.md`, or `PLAN.md`) written in a format a human reviewer or downstream stakeholder can consume directly.

The skills chain naturally. A typical agency workflow:

1. Run `competitor-gap-analysis` to see what opportunities exist.
2. Run `keyword-cluster-planner` on the gap output to plan content.
3. Run `content-brief` on each cluster's pillar topic.
4. Run `backlink-gap` to identify link targets for the new content.
5. Run `website-audit-change-report` monthly to catch regressions.
6. Run `ai-search-share-of-voice` quarterly to track LLM visibility.

## Rate limits and costs

The SE Ranking MCP server has two namespaces with different rate limits:

- **Data API** (`DATA_*`): 10 requests per second. Charges API credits per call.
- **Project API** (`PROJECT_*`): 5 requests per second. Retrieval and management calls do not charge; writes consume quota slots.

Every skill in this repo is designed to pace sequentially inside these limits. The largest skills (`competitor-gap-analysis` with full keyword dumps, `keyword-cluster-planner` with 20 seeds) can consume thousands of credits on large domains. Check `DATA_getCreditBalance` before running on production accounts, and use the `ceiling` parameters the skills document to cap cost.

## Contributing
