# Claude SEO Skills

Production-ready [Claude Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) for SEO, powered by the [SE Ranking remote MCP](https://seranking.com/api/integrations/mcp). Each skill turns raw API data into a finished SEO deliverable — content briefs, AI Search share of voice, page intelligence, structured data, drift monitoring, SXO diagnostics, competitive analysis, and more.

These Claude Skills are designed to work with the SE Ranking MCP server, but they document every API call explicitly so they can also be adapted to other SEO data providers.

## Install

Three ways. Pick the first one that fits.

### 1. Claude Desktop (recommended)

The easiest setup — no terminal needed. Cowork in Claude Desktop installs the plugin from a marketplace through a UI flow.

1. Open **Customize** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Personal plugin** → **+ Create plugin**.
3. Click **Add marketplace** and enter `seranking/seo-skills`.
4. Install the plugin once the marketplace loads.

Skills are available in your next Cowork session. Trigger them by name — `seo-content-brief`, `seo-page`, etc. — or just describe what you want and Claude picks the right one.

### 2. Claude Code (slash commands)

If you use Claude Code in the terminal:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add seranking/seo-skills
/plugin install seo-skills@seranking
```

Trigger skills with `/seo-content-brief`, `/seo-page`, etc. — no `seo-skills:` prefix needed. Or just describe what you want and Claude picks the right skill. Update the marketplace later with `/plugin marketplace update seranking`.

### 3. Manual install (only if you want `seo-google` or the optional extensions)

Options 1 and 2 cover **21 of 22 skills**. The 22nd — `seo-google` — ships Python scripts that need a local clone. The optional Firecrawl + Google extensions also need this. **If neither matters to you, skip this option.**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/seranking/seo-skills.git
bash seo-skills/install.sh
```

The installer is interactive — it asks which extensions to install. Accept the defaults and you're done. Re-running pulls the latest version and re-runs the chosen extensions. Requires `git`, `python3` 3.10+, and (for Firecrawl) `node` 20+.

<details>
<summary>One-liner (curl)</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seranking/seo-skills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --all
```

`--all` enables both extensions. Use `--firecrawl` / `--google` individually, or `--no-extensions` to clone only. Default clone target is `~/.local/share/seo-skills`; override with `--target /path/to/dir`.

</details>

The manual install only wires your *environment* (extensions, Python deps, `~/.config/seo-skills/`). You still need Option 1 or 2 above so Claude can find the skill files.

### Connect SE Ranking (any install path)

All skills are powered by the SE Ranking remote MCP. Connect it once:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http se-ranking https://api.seranking.com/mcp
```

Run `/mcp` in your next session and sign in via OAuth. No API token to manage. If you don't have an SE Ranking account yet, [sign up](https://seranking.com/api.html) — API access is required.

## Optional extensions

Some skills work best when paired with optional MCP servers or Python toolchains beyond SE Ranking. Each extension is opt-in — the skills that use it degrade gracefully when it's absent (the affected sections emit `(skipped — extension not installed)` notes rather than failing the run).

The fastest way to install both extensions is the top-level `install.sh` ([Install option 3](#3-manual-install-only-if-you-want-seo-google-or-the-optional-extensions)). The per-extension scripts below are equivalent — use them when you only want one of the two, or when you've already cloned the repo and want to install/re-install a single extension without re-running the wrapper.

### Firecrawl (raw HTML, JSON-LD, JS rendering, site crawl)

`WebFetch` returns markdown only — every `<head>` `<meta>` tag, every `<link rel="canonical">`, every `<script type="application/ld+json">` block is stripped before the skill sees it. The Firecrawl extension closes that gap and adds full-site crawl, URL discovery, in-site search, and screenshots.

```bash
# From inside a clone of this repo:
bash extensions/firecrawl/install.sh
```

The script verifies Node 20+, prompts for your `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` (free tier is 500 credits/month at <https://firecrawl.dev>), and idempotently merges the MCP entry into `~/.claude/settings.json` (existing entries preserved). See [`extensions/firecrawl/README.md`](extensions/firecrawl/README.md) for full setup, free-tier credit math, troubleshooting, and tool-prefix details.

**Skills that gain capabilities when Firecrawl is installed:** `seo-page`, `seo-schema`, `seo-geo`, `seo-technical-audit`, `seo-sitemap`, `seo-content-audit`, `seo-drift`, `seo-content-brief`, `seo-competitor-pages`, `seo-sxo`, `seo-backlinks-profile`, plus the dedicated `seo-firecrawl` orchestrator. Every Firecrawl-using skill supports a `--no-firecrawl` flag to opt out at runtime even when the extension is installed (saves credits).

### Google APIs (real CWV, GSC, GA4, YouTube, Keyword Planner)

The `seo-google` skill needs the Google API client libraries plus a free Google Cloud project. All Google APIs used here are free (with quotas). Setup is one-time. Adapted with attribution from [`AgriciDaniel/claude-seo`](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo)'s upstream `seo-google` skill (MIT) — same Python scripts and reference docs, namespaced to `~/.config/seo-skills/`.

```bash
# From inside a clone of this repo:
bash extensions/google/install.sh
```

The script verifies Python 3.10+, pip-installs the Google API libraries (`google-api-python-client`, `google-auth*`, `google-analytics-data`, plus `matplotlib` + `weasyprint` + `openpyxl` for PDF/HTML/XLSX reports), creates `~/.config/seo-skills/`, writes a stub `google-api.json`, and runs the credential checker.

Fill in the config per [`skills/seo-google/references/auth-setup.md`](skills/seo-google/references/auth-setup.md) (8-step walkthrough). The skill detects which tier is unlocked and only enables the matching commands — Tier 0 (API key) gives PSI + CrUX + YouTube + NLP + Knowledge Graph + Web Risk; Tier 1 (+ service account) adds GSC + Indexing; Tier 2 (+ GA4 property ID) adds GA4; Tier 3 (+ Ads dev token) adds Keyword Planner. See [`extensions/google/README.md`](extensions/google/README.md) for full setup, troubleshooting, and rate-limit reference.

**Skills that gain capabilities when Google APIs are configured:** `seo-google` (the dedicated skill — fully gated on this extension), plus `seo-page`, `seo-drift`, `seo-technical-audit`, `seo-content-audit`, `seo-sitemap`, `seo-geo`, `seo-keyword-cluster`, `seo-keyword-niche`, and `seo-plan` (real impressions/clicks/conversions/CWV instead of estimates when configured).

## How these skills work

Each skill is a single `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter. Claude loads the frontmatter at startup to know when to use the skill, then loads the body only when triggered, then reads any bundled reference files only when needed. This is Anthropic's [progressive disclosure](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) pattern.

A typical skill run produces:

1. A set of numbered raw-data markdown files (`01-domain-overview.md`, `02-competitors.md`, etc.) for auditability.
2. Optionally, a CSV for spreadsheet work.
3. A final synthesised deliverable (`BRIEF.md`, `REPORT.md`, or `PLAN.md`) written in a format a human reviewer or downstream stakeholder can consume directly.

The skills chain naturally. A typical agency workflow:

1. Run `seo-competitor-gap-analysis` to see what opportunities exist.
2. Run `seo-keyword-cluster` on the gap output to plan content.
3. Run `seo-content-brief` on each cluster's pillar topic.
4. Run `seo-backlink-gap` to identify link targets for the new content.
5. Run `seo-ai-search-share-of-voice` quarterly to track LLM visibility.

```

The repo is a Claude Code marketplace whose single plugin is the repo itself (marketplace `plugins[0].source` is `"./"`). This keeps skill folders visible at the top level rather than buried two layers deep.

Every skill writes its output to a folder named `{skill-slug}-{target-slug}-{YYYYMMDD}/` (e.g., `seo-content-brief-example-com-20260427/`). The date stamp keeps re-runs non-destructive and makes it easy to diff outputs over time. Browse [`examples/`](./examples/) to see what a finished run looks like before installing.

## Rate limits and costs

The SE Ranking MCP server has two namespaces with different rate limits:

- **Data API** (`DATA_*`): 10 requests per second. Charges API credits per call.
- **Project API** (`PROJECT_*`): 5 requests per second. Retrieval and management calls do not charge; writes consume quota slots.

Every skill in this repo is designed to pace sequentially inside these limits. The largest skills (`seo-competitor-gap-analysis` with full keyword dumps, `seo-keyword-cluster` with 20 seeds) can consume thousands of credits on large domains. Check `DATA_getCreditBalance` before running on production accounts, and use the `ceiling` parameters the skills document to cap cost.

## Contributing

This repo is the official Skills catalogue for the SE Ranking MCP server. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the skill-authoring template, required structure, MCP tool conventions, and PR checklist.

- **Bug reports** — open an issue with the skill name, the input, and the unexpected output.
- **New skills** — PRs welcome. Use the template in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Improvements** — PRs welcome. Include a before/after example run in the PR description.
